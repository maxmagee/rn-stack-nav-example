# Stack Navigation Example With React-Navigation

This was built as an exercise for me and to assist someone with an explanation.

## Instructions
* Install Node.js / npm.
* Install Expo CLI.
* If you want to use linting / prettier setup:
  * Use Visual Studio Code.
  * Install ESLint Extension.
  * Install Prettier Extension.
  * Update your user settings json file with the settings from ``myVsCodeUserSettings.json`` file.
* Within the root directory run ``npm install``.
* Once completed, run ``npm start``.
* You'll eventually be prompted to open the app on a simulator or device.
  * Press ``i`` on the terminal window to open on an iPhone simulator within the Expo client app.

## Notes
This uses ``react-navigation`` version 4. There are differences from version 5, should you choose to use that.

I initially tried to break up different sections into their own stack navigators, but that ended up having sub-headers and caused more problems than it was worth. Consequently, it's now all in one stack navigator.

I also gave examples of how you might pass data via the navigation.
